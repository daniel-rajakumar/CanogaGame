## March 19 - Core System Implementation

09:30: Implemented a dark theme user interface to improve visual comfort during extended development sessions. The new color scheme reduces eye strain while maintaining clear visibility of all game elements.

15:00: Established the foundational architecture for game state management. Created a comprehensive system of API endpoints to handle all core game actions and maintain consistent state across sessions.

## March 20 - User Interface Enhancements

14:15: Developed a modal interface component to allow manual dice input. This feature accommodates players who prefer digital play without physical dice.

16:30: Performed code quality improvements by standardizing event listener syntax throughout the application. Resolved inconsistencies in implementation patterns.

## March 24 - Artificial Intelligence Development

10:00: Designed and implemented decision-making algorithms for computer-controlled opponents. The AI evaluates board positions and selects optimal moves based on current game state.

15:20: Enhanced the in-game help system to provide contextual explanations for suggested moves. The improved system now offers strategic insights to assist players.

## March 27 - Tournament System Implementation

13:45: Developed the tournament conclusion protocol, including winner declaration procedures and victory screen display logic. The system properly handles tie scenarios and score-based outcomes.

18:10: Corrected and refined the advantage calculation system for square coverage. Implemented proper rendering adjustments to accurately reflect player advantages.

## March 28 - Documentation and Optimization

11:00: Authored comprehensive technical documentation covering core game classes and their interactions. Created detailed API references and usage examples.

14:30: Performed significant codebase optimization by removing deprecated code segments and improving overall structure. Enhanced readability through consistent formatting.

## Winter Break - Project Restart & Semester Wrap-Up
Oct 20 - Restarting the project again

10:10: Started my project again and re-opened everything to remember what was going on.

16:40: Made a quick plan for what needs to be finished this semester (UI first, then logic, then demos + documentation).

## Oct 22 - Full refactor

11:30: The game was too complex, so i had to refactor the whole code.

18:20: Rebuilt the game flow so actions update state cleanly and the UI always refreshes correctly.

## Oct 27 - Getting the structure stable

12:15: Cleaned up the file structure and removed old experimental code that was making things confusing.

## Nov 2 - UI progress

13:05: Finished the main board layout and the core UI components needed for gameplay.

## Nov 9 - UI interactions

14:20: Improved button states and disabled logic so players can tell what moves are allowed.

## Nov 16 - improve the UI and make it more user friendly 

11:45: Added clearer visual indicators for covered/uncovered squares so the board state is easier to read.

16:10: Improved the victory screen layout and made the tournament end screen feel complete.

## Nov 23 - UI milestone

15:00: Done with full UI.

19:10: Did a full playthrough just to test the entire UI flow from start to finish. Some worked, and some did not. 

## Nov 30 - Logic close to done

14:30: Almost done with the logic.

18:50: Fixed edge cases where certain moves could break the UI from the game state.

## Dec 6 - Tournament + end conditions

12:00: Verified tournament scoring and tie outcomes across multiple rounds.

## Dec 13 - First demo

18:00: Had my first demo of the semester for this project. It had a bug that the game did not end on uncovering

19:40: Fixed the end-condition bug and re-tested with the same scenario to confirm it ends correctly now.

## Dec 15 - Final demo + cleanup

11:00: Had final demo

18:15: Cleaned up the code and wrote documentation (removed unused code, organized files, updated docs).
