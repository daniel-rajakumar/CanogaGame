# Technical Reasons for choosing JavaScript

- Web Compatibility: It makes building UIs seamless and fast compared to building a native application.
- Ecosystem: It has a really good and active ecosystem of frameworks such as Express.js that I used in the project.
- JSON: Native JSON support made serialization for the game state much easier.

# Experience with JavaScript

- I deeply admire JavaScript as a language; it has a highly active development community that continually evolves the language every day. 
- Dynamic typing makes writing code faster, but it can also be confusing as the project grew. 
- I also liked that it is a C-style language, which I am already familiar with. 
- Lastly, the package manager system that Node.js (backend) uses is overall great and makes managing packages with NPM very easy.

- I disliked the lack of strict typing, which led to many runtime errors that could have been caught at compile time in C++. 
- There were two places I had to keep track of the project's log (backend and frontend), which was inconvenient but was organized.

# Problems

- I did not really have as many problems using JavaScript compared to C++; if anything, I found more resources on the internet about my errors than I would have for C++. 
- One critical issue with JavaScript is its fast-changing environment; even videos from two years ago can be considered outdated in the JavaScript world, especially with frontend development. 
- I had a challenge choosing a framework that was both stable and up-to-date with the JavaScript language. 
- I was not able to debug my frontend JavaScript with the VS Code debugger tool (for example, stopping the code when it reached a certain line), which forced me to use console.log to check the state of variables at the time. 

# Compare to C++

- C++ is much faster than JavaScript, but performance was not really a factor in this project. 
- JavaScript uses a garbage collector while C++ uses manual memory management. Both have pros and cons. 
- JavaScript relies on browser tools to debug, while C++ debugging is more tied to software tools such as IDEs. 
- JavaScript runs on any browser, which is already installed on every modern computer, whereas C++ requires tooling to be configured in order to run. 

Overall, I enjoyed learning and using JavaScript compared to C++, and I would recommend it to others. This was my choice of programming language because of its rich web capabilities and quick development cycle, though the IDE tools were not as helpful compared to those available for C++.
